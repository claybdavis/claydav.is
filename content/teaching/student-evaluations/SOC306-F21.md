"I believe I became a stronger writer after reading Clay's comments on my papers. I
appreciated the time that Clay took to suggest ways to make my papers stronger"

"one of my favorite TAs so far! he was very understanding, prompt, and had a gentle and understanding manner. he summarized points clearly and gave great feedback that was insightful on our weekly papers. he was very kind and seemed to be passionate & knowledgable"

"[Clay's] summaries and mini–lectures at the start of classes were definitely vital for my understanding of the class..."

"Clay is very knowledgeable and helpful, as well as willing to go the extra mile to make sure a student understands a concept. I also appreciated their organization skills and how clearly and concisely they relayed information."

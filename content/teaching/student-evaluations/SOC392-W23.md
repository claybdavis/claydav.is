"Helped me begin thinking about the ways in which modern science and politics are intertwined..."

"Yes, the course was split into helpful modules that made digesting the readings and information very manageable. The cohesive themes that corresponded with our midterm writing assignments..."

"really interesting class and topics were incorporated well into discussions on current events! professor Davis was very interactive during discussions and he always seemed excited to talk about the readings with the class"

"Really engaging topics, professor was great at helping us understand more complicated readings, and writing the essays helped solidify my comprehension as well!"

"Genuinely one of the most prepared professors I’ve seen. Always comes into class with a million different topics we could talk about, and always highlights the import aspects of each reading so that we make sure we understand, but does it in a way that makes us tell him. Always super responsive and supportive to students..."

"very knowledgable, enthusiastic in generating discussion, good at breaking concepts into smaller pieces for student comprehension, engaging and brings in useful multimedia examples to expand upon content, asks for and listens to students input to better format assignments and readings"

"i learned the most from the paper 2 prompt. applying class concepts and theories to a piece of scientific writing allowed me to see how the things we discussed in class translate to real life. while it is one thing to conceptualize terms and concepts like the lay public and expertise on paper, it is another to see the real process that occurs when science is displayed through media. especially in a media driven world, i found this assignment insightful in relation to the course and useful to my own personal understandings of how science and society interact in the current moment."

"I learned a ton. Prof Davis is one of the best I have had at NU. I am very sad I won't be able to take another with him!"

"The syllabus was designed in a logical and engaging way, moving from foundational theoretical texts to extensions and concrete applications of those ideas. The themes we covered throughout the course allowed us to explore a range of pressing issues at the intersection of science, technology and society. Clay was especially effective at tailoring the course to the class participants’ interests while maintaining a solid structure. The class meetings themselves were just the right balance of lecturing and discussion; Clay provided us with the conceptual tools and mutual understanding of the content before guiding us in more open discussions. Finally, I really enjoyed writing the papers assigned throughout the quarter, as they allowed me to apply new theoretical lenses to topics that I already had a deep interest in."

"This course was great! Clay is literally amazing and does a great job of making the sociological theories and info this course accessible to students who may not be studying sociology."

"This is probably my favorite class that I’ve taken throughout my time at NU. The readings each week were so thought–provoking, and I believe students of any major would benefit from the materials and discussions."

"Taking it with Clay was also a great experience because he is so knowledgeable and down–to-earth, and a great communicator when it comes to explaining some very complex ideas and topics."

"Clay was skilled at making complex theories and concepts understandable to students with and without sociological backgrounds. In classroom discussions, he effectively encouraged us to make our own connections between materials and real–world cases, which helped clearly explain the significance of the arguments that we covered. He also fostered a classroom environment where it felt safe and productive to explore diverging perspectives on serious social issues. Finally, Clay clearly took the time to get to know each class participant and showed a sincere interest in our growth. He is a wonderful instructor and human, and I’m grateful to have gotten to learn from him."

"Clay was clearly invested in this topic, and he really put in so much effort to make this class an effective intro to STS. The readings he selected were quintessential reads in the field, and they were really impactful and engaging. He effectively led discussions among the class, leading to really fruitful classes."

"Incredible communicator, especially when it comes to more complex ideas. I felt like Clay was so great at synthesizing main ideas and arguments of the authors in a way that was easy to understand and compelling. "

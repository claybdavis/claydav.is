I am a PhD Candidate in Sociology and Mellon Cluster Fellow in science studies at [Northwestern University](https://sociology.northwestern.edu/people/graduate-students/profiles/clay-davis.html). My work is concerned with the tensions between democracy and expertise. In my dissertation, I study how surgeons, judges, and global health NGOs use the statistical method of meta-analysis to make ostensibly objective decisions. In their reliance on meta-analysis, these actors transform social conflicts into statistical ones, enacting what I call "*P*-value politics."

In earlier work, I focused on the clashes between health social movements and biomedical experts. In my [2023 *Social Studies of Science* paper](/publications/peer-reviewed-papers/3s2/), I explain how a group of people with type 1 diabetes who engineered an open-source artificial pancreas "routinized" their lay expertise. And in my [2020 *Social Studies of Science* paper](/publications/peer-reviewed-papers/3s1/), I study how contemporary HIV/AIDS activists challenged clinical researchers' definition of being "at risk" for HIV.
